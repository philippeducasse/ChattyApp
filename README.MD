## ChattyApp Chat App

This project aims at creating an App for mobile devices using React Native. The app will
provide users with a chat interface and options to share images and their
location.

## Technologies Used

- React Native
- Expo (toolchain to write native apps in JS)
- React Native Gifted Chat library
- Google Firestore DB
- Google Firebase Authentication
- AsyncStorage caching for offline use
- Firebase cloud storage (for storing images)
- Expo ImagePicker & MediaLibrary for integrating communication features

## Key Features

- A page where users can enter their name and choose a background color for the chat screen
before joining the chat.
- A page displaying the conversation, as well as an input field and submit button.
- The chat must provide users with two additional communication features: sending images
and location data.
- Data gets stored online and offline.

## How to set up the application

* As this application requires react native and is developped with Expo, the first step involves downgrading (if necessary) to a node version compatible with Expo:

- npm install 16.19.0
- npm use 16.19.0
- npm alias default 16.19.0

Next, install expo CLI on your machine: 

- npm install -g expo-cli

Then create an expo account (https://expo.dev/), and either install expo on your smartphone, or install a virtual machine on your computer.

* Create a react native line by running this command:

npx create-expo-app ChattyApp --template

Run expo:

- npm start, or expo start

- Run 'npm i whatwg-fetch@3.6.2' (current whatwg version causes issues with images being able to be sent. This version still functions as intended.)


sync Metro Bundler either with your smartphone (you will need to install the expoGo app) or using your device emulator to see the app live.

### Database configuration

If you wish to use your own database for this project, then create a new database on https://firebase.google.com (signup is required first). 

then run  'npm i firebase'

- Navigate to the console ('Go To Console' in the top right)
- Add project
- Once in the project use 'Build->Firestore Database' on the left sid eof the screen under product categories
- Create Database, Start in production mode, hit next and then enable.
- Once in Firestore Database navigate to rules and change 'allow read, write: if false;' to 'allow read, write: if true;' and publish.
- Navigate to 'Project Settings->General'
- Under 'Your apps' select webapp (</>)
- Select a nickname (you don't have to setup Firebase Hosting) and follow the prompts.
- Copy the section of code starting with 'const firebaseConfig =' and paste it into App.js replacing what is in there already.
const firebaseConfig = {
    [your unique credentials]
  };

Set up Android Studio
